# News Feed Manager

**News Feed Manager** is a service designed to manage and update news feeds. It is part of a news aggregation system where the primary application fetches and displays news from various sources. This service is responsible for retrieving updates from specified news feeds and storing them in the designated file system location.

## Features

- **Update All Feeds:** Retrieve and update all configured news feeds.
- **Update Specific Feed:** Retrieve and update a specific news feed based on its source.
- **Manage Feeds:** Load news feeds from a JSON configuration file.
- **Flexible Configuration:** Configure paths for feeds and resources via command-line flags.

## Usage
The service can be run locally or as a Docker container. The following are the available command-line flags:

- `-resource`: The name of the news feed to update.
- `-feeds-config`: The path to the JSON configuration file containing news feeds.
- `-resources-path`: The path to the directory where the news feed resources are stored.

## Requirements
- Go 1.22
- Docker

## Local Setup
### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/news-feed-updater.git
cd news-feed-updater
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
go mod download
```

### 3. Build the Application
```bash
go build -o news-feed-updater main.go
```

### 4. Run the Application
```bash
./news-updater -resource=example -feeds-config=./config/feeds_dictionary.json -resources-path=./resources
```

## Docker
### 1. Build the Docker Image
```bash
docker build -t news-feed-updater .
```

### 2. Run the Docker Container
```bash
docker run -v /path/to/config:/app/config -v /path/to/resources:/app/resources news-feed-updater -resource=example -feeds-config=/app/config/feeds_dictionary.json -resources-path=/app/resources
```

## Configuration
The service requires a JSON configuration file to manage news feeds.
The configuration file should contain a dictionary of news sources with their respective URLs.
The following is an example of a configuration file:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "abc-news",
    "format": "RSS",
    "url": "https://feeds.abcnews.com/abcnews/internationalheadlines"
  },
  {
    "name": "washington-times",
    "format": "RSS",
    "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/rss/headlines/news/world/"
  },
  {
    "name": "bbc-world",
    "format": "RSS",
    "url": "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml"
  }
]
```

Essentially,
the configuration file should be a dictionary where the key is the source name
and the value is the URL of the news feed.
This file is usually generated by the news-aggregator application.
